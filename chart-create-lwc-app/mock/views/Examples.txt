Examples:
Asset Health
Being able to chart multiple ranges and display multiple values for each range.
Being able to implement a gradual color gradient, at the separation points for each range (red, yellow, and green)
Being able to not only display a static value for each range, but also a dynamic value, depending on where the user hovers.

Utilization (Utilization was a line chart in AA, but there was a series of advanced features that weren't easy to implement) 
"Advanced" chart legend interactions.
Being able to hide individual lines (legend items)
Having the lines drop opacity when the user hovers over a specific legend item.
Sorting legend items
Searching chart legend items, and having the chart interact with the search performed.
Rendering (painting) larger data sets was an issue, benchmarking should be done.
